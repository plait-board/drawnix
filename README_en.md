## About the Name

***Drawnix*** is born from the interweaving of ***Draw*** and ***Phoenix***, a fusion of artistic inspiration.

The *Phoenix* symbolizes endless creativity, while *Draw* represents humanity's most fundamental form of expression. Here, each creation is an artistic rebirth, every stroke a renaissance of inspiration.

Like a Phoenix, creativity must rise from the flames to be reborn, and ***Drawnix*** stands as the guardian of both technical and creative fire.

*Draw Beyond, Rise Above.*

## About Plait Drawing Framework

*Drawnix* is positioned as an out-of-the-box, *open-source*, and free tool product. It is built on top of the *Plait* framework, which is our company's *open-source* drawing framework representing significant technical accumulation in knowledge base products.


*Drawnix* uses a *plugin architecture*, which is technically more complex than the previously mentioned *open-source* tools. However, this *plugin architecture* has its advantages: it supports multiple *UI frameworks* (*Angular*, *React*), integrates with different *rich text frameworks* (currently only supporting *Slate* framework), enables better business layer separation in development, allows development of various fine-grained reusable plugins, and can expand to more whiteboard application scenarios.
